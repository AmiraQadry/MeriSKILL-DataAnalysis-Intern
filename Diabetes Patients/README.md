#  Pima Women Diabetes Diagnosis Prediction
This project focuses on predicting diabetes diagnosis in Pima Indian women using machine learning techniques(LR Model) that achieves 75% accuracy. It utilizes a dataset that includes various health measurements of Pima Indian women along with their corresponding diabetes diagnosis.

## Dataset
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is the original source of this dataset. The dataset's goal is to use certain diagnostic metrics included in the collection to diagnostically forecast if a patient has diabetes. These cases were chosen from a bigger database under a number of restrictions. Particularly, all patients at this facility are Pima Indian women who are at least 21 years old.2
 One target dependent variable (Outcome) and one independent variable (a number of medical predictor variables) may both be found in the data set in the (.csv) file.

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function.
- Age: Age (years).
- Outcome: Diabetes diagnosis (0: No diabetes, 1: Diabetes).

The rules that were developed as a result of this effort will assist clinicians recognize patients with diabetes. In addition, early disease prediction enables treating patients before their condition deteriorates.
