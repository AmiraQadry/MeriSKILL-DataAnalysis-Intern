#  Pima Women Diabetes Diagnosis Prediction
This project focuses on predicting diabetes diagnosis in Pima Indian women using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset that includes various health measurements of Pima Indian women along with their corresponding diabetes diagnosis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored in the file pima_diabetes.csv. It consists of the following columns:

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function.
- Age: Age (years).
- Outcome: Diabetes diagnosis (0: No diabetes, 1: Diabetes).
  
## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
