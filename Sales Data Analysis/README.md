# Sales-Data-Analysis

## TASK
Analyze Sales Data.

## TOOL
Python, Power BI, and Tableau

## DESCRIPTION
In this project, I dive into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights. I explore sales trends over time, identify the best-selling products, calculate revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins, and create visualizations to present your findings effectively. This project showcases my ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling me to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.

## Data Preparation
Perform any necessary data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data types as needed.

## Analysis

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Overview of the sales dataset, examining data structure and summary statistics.
   - Identification of data quality issues, missing values, or outliers.

2. Sales Performance Analysis:
   - Calculation of aggregated sales metrics (e.g., total sales, average sales, sales by cities).
   - Identification of trends, seasonality, and patterns in sales data over time.
   - Comparison of sales performance across different product categories, Cities.

3. Product Analysis:
   - Identification of top-selling products based on sales revenue or quantity ordered.

## Visualization:
### For Notebook
- Visualizations are created using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Charts and graphs are used to present sales trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics effectively.
  
### For Power Bi and Tableau DASHBOARDS
- Power Bi and Tableau offer a wide range of visualizations, including charts, tables, maps, and interactive dashboards.
- Visualizations are created to effectively communicate sales insights and trends.
- Customize the visuals by adding appropriate titles, labels, legends, and colors to enhance clarity and understanding.
