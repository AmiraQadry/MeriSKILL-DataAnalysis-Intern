# HR Analytics Project

This project aims to analyze HR data to gain insights into various aspects of performance, attrition. It utilizes Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries to perform the analysis.

## Project Overview

The HR Analytics project is divided into the following sections:

1. Data Exploration: Explore the HR dataset to understand its structure, variables, and data quality.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform in-depth analysis and visualization to identify patterns, correlations, and trends in the HR data.

4. Employee Attrition Prediction: Build LR model to predict employee attrition and evaluate their performance.

5. Employee Performance Analysis: Analyze employee performance metrics and identify factors contributing to high or low performance.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the HR data files used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, EDA, and modeling.
- `visualizations/`: Stores the visualizations generated during the analysis in notebook and using Power Bi.
- `reports/`: Contains project reports, summaries, and findings.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading.

## Getting Started
